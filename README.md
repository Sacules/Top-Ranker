# Top Ranker

A simple, basic Python script that reads text files that contain ranked lists of movies, videogames, albums, etc. Top Ranker gathers those, give them a score based on position, and ranks them - top 10, top 50, etc. Useful for gathering info about a community's tastes on the mentioned items.

At this very stage, it can only read local files, and it's terminal-based. The resulting top is saved into a text file.

Output example of top 10 albums:
